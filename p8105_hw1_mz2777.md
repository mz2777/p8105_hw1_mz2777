# Problem 1

### Create the Dataframe

``` r
#Create the data frame
df_p1 = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(8, mean = 0, sd = 1),
  norm_samp_logical = norm_samp > 0,
  char_vec = c("A", "B", "C", "A", "B", "B", "C", "B"),
  fac_vec = factor(char_vec, labels = c("I","II","III"))
)
```

### Take the Mean

Character and factor variables did not work when the `mean` function was
applied to them. The erroe messages are as
    follows.

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df_p1, char_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df_p1, fac_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

### Applying the `as.numeric` Function

After applying the `as.numeric` function to the logical, character and
factor variables, logical and factor variables are able to be converted
to numeric variable. Since unlike character variables, these two kind of
variables can be represented by the numbers without losing their logic
and meanings. Therefore, this conversion can help explain why the mean
value of the character variables can not be calculated.

``` r
#as.numeric
as.numeric(pull(df_p1, norm_samp_logical))
as.numeric(pull(df_p1, char_vec))
as.numeric(pull(df_p1, fac_vec))
```

### Conversions and Multiplications.

  - convert the logical vector to numeric, and multiply the random
    sample by the result
  - convert the logical vector to a factor, and multiply the random
    sample by the result
  - convert the logical vector to a factor and then convert the result
    to numeric, and multiply the random sample by the
result

<!-- end list -->

``` r
#convert the logical vector to numeric, and multiply the random sample by the result
as.numeric(pull(df_p1, norm_samp_logical)) * pull(df_p1, norm_samp)
```

    ## [1] 0.0000000 0.0000000 1.2747888 0.0000000 0.9439408 0.0000000 1.0138392
    ## [8] 0.8838442

``` r
#convert the logical vector to a factor, and multiply the random sample by the result
factor(pull(df_p1, norm_samp_logical)) * pull(df_p1, norm_samp)
```

    ## Warning in Ops.factor(factor(pull(df_p1, norm_samp_logical)), pull(df_p1, :
    ## '*' not meaningful for factors

    ## [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
#convert the logical vector to a factor and then convert the result to numeric, and multiply the random sample by the result
as.numeric(factor(pull(df_p1, norm_samp_logical))) * pull(df_p1, norm_samp)
```

    ## [1] -0.3300906 -0.8196825  2.5495776 -0.4758536  1.8878815 -1.2855493
    ## [7]  2.0276784  1.7676883

# Problem 2

### Create the Dataframe

``` r
#create the dataframe
df_p2 = tibble(
  x = rnorm(500, mean = 0, sd = 1),
  y = rnorm(500, mean = 0, sd = 1),
  logic_vec = x + y > 1,
  logic2num = as.numeric(logic_vec),
  logic2fac = factor(logic_vec)
)
```

### Short Description

A short description of the data frame I have built.

  - The size of the dataset is 500\*5.
  - The mean of x is 0.0286271.
  - The median of x is -0.0144882.
  - The standard deviation of x is 0.99192.
  - The proportion of cases for which x + y \> 1 is 24.6%.

### Scatterplot

Make scatterplots of y vs x that color points using the logical, numeric
and factor variables, respectively.

#### Color Scale

We can see from legends that the logical and factor variables are
binary, true or false, and there are only two kind of colors in the
legends. However, for numeric variable, the legendâ€™s rage is from 0 to 1
though there is no value between 0 and 1.

``` r
#color point using the logical variable
pic1 = ggplot(df_p2, aes(x = x, y = y, color = logic_vec)) + 
  geom_point() + ggtitle("Color points using the logical variable")
pic1
```

#color point using the numeric variable

#color point using the factor variable

  geom_point() + ggtitle("Color points using the factor variable")
pic3
```

#export the first scatterplot
ggsave("scatter point.png", plot = pic1)
